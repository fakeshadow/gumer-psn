Rename .env_sample to .env and change whatever params you want


your token is stored in cert/tokens.json. It's safe to disable cert.save() function
if you don't feel like to store it.



api endpoints:

login      /your_uuid/your_2FA
profile    /profile/user_psn_name


issue:
no actual check for token expire time;
Poor error handling;
messy code;
